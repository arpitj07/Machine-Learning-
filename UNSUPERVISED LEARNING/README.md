Unsupervised learning is the training of machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns and differences without any prior training of data.

Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the machine. Therefore machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by our-self.

  Unsupervised learning classified into two categories of algorithms:

  - **Clustering:** A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by      purchasing behavior.
  - **Association:** An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data,      such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.

### Cluster Analysis:

   Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. Given a set of data points, we can use a clustering algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group. In theory, data points that are in the same group should have similar properties and/or features, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.
