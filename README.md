## Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
