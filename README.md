## Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

### Unsupervised Learning [[Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/supervised-unsupervised-learning/)]

Unsupervised learning is the training of machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns and differences without any prior training of data.

Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the machine. Therefore machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by our-self.

- **Types** [[Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/supervised-unsupervised-learning/)]
  
  Unsupervised learning classified into two categories of algorithms:

  - **Clustering:** A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by      purchasing behavior.
  - **Association:** An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data,      such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.

### Semi Supervised Learning


### Reinforcement Learning [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/types-of-machine-learning-algorithms-you-should-know-953a08248861)

method aims at using observations gathered from the interaction with the environment to take actions that would maximize the reward or minimize the risk. Reinforcement learning algorithm (**called the agent**) continuously learns from the environment in an iterative fashion. In the process, the agent learns from its experiences of the environment until it explores the full range of possible states.

In order to produce intelligent programs (also called agents), reinforcement learning goes through the following steps:

- Input state is observed by the agent.
- Decision making function is used to make the agent perform an action.
- After the action is performed, the agent receives reward or reinforcement from the environment.
- The state-action pair information about the reward is stored.
