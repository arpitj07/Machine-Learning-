## Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

### Semi Supervised Learning


### Reinforcement Learning [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/types-of-machine-learning-algorithms-you-should-know-953a08248861)

method aims at using observations gathered from the interaction with the environment to take actions that would maximize the reward or minimize the risk. Reinforcement learning algorithm (**called the agent**) continuously learns from the environment in an iterative fashion. In the process, the agent learns from its experiences of the environment until it explores the full range of possible states.

In order to produce intelligent programs (also called agents), reinforcement learning goes through the following steps:

- Input state is observed by the agent.
- Decision making function is used to make the agent perform an action.
- After the action is performed, the agent receives reward or reinforcement from the environment.
- The state-action pair information about the reward is stored.
