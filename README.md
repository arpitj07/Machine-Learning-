## Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms try to **_model relationships and dependencies between the target prediction output and the input features_** such that we can predict the output values for new data based on those relationships which it learned from the previous data sets.

Most of the time we are not able to figure out the true function that always make the correct predictions and other reason is that the algorithm rely upon an assumption made by humans about how the computer should learn and **this assumptions introduce a bias**.
