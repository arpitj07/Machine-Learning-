Supervised learning algorithms try to **_model relationships and dependencies between the target prediction output and the input features_** such that we can predict the output values for new data based on those relationships which it learned from the previous data sets.

Most of the time we are not able to figure out the true function that always make the correct predictions and other reason is that the algorithm rely upon an assumption made by humans about how the computer should learn and **this assumptions introduce a bias**.

    Supervised learning classified into two categories of algorithms:
   - **Classification:** A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “Red” or “blue” or “disease” and         “no disease”.
   -  **Regression:** A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.
