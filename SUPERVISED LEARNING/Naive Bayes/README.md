# Naive Bayes Algorithm

“Naive Bayes is a family of probabilistic algorithms that take advantage of probability theory and Bayes’ Theorem to predict the category of a sample (like a piece of news or a customer review). They are probabilistic, which means that they calculate the probability of each category for a given sample, and then output the category with the highest one.” [[**HERE**](https://qr.ae/TWhYrq)]
